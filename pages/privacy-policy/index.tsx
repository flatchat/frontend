                <p>
                    Any person utilising the Portal ("User" or "you" or "your") or any of its features (" Services ") shall be bound by this Privacy Policy.

                    FlatChat respects the privacy of its Users and is committed to protecting it in all respects.

                <h2>Purpose and Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    To avail of certain Services on the Portal, Users would be required to provide certain information for the registration process, namely:
                    1. Name
                    2. Mobile No
                    3. Email address

                    In the course of providing you with access to the Services, and in order to provide you access to the features offered through the Portal to verify your identity and secure your account details, you may give us the permission to capture, record your device information, operating system information, network information, location information.

                    In the course of providing the Services, Users may invite other existing Users or other users ("Invited Users") to participate in any of the Services by providing the email address or Mobile Number of such users. FlatChat may thereafter use this information to contact the Invited User and invite such users to register with FlatChat (if such Invited User is not an existing User). The User hereby represents that the Invited Users have consented and agreed to such disclosure to and use of their email address and Mobile Number by FlatChat.

                    All required information is specific and based on the kind of services the User wishes to participate in or access and will be utilised for the purpose of providing services, including but not limited to the Services requested by the User. The information supplied by the Users enables us to improve the Services.

                    FlatChat may also share such information with affiliates and third parties in limited circumstances, including for the purpose of providing services requested by the User, complying with legal processes, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.

                </p>

                <h2>Disclosure/Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    FlatChat may also share information as provided by you and data concerning usage of the Services with third-party service providers engaged by FlatChat, for the purpose of data analytics or other similar purposes, for the purpose of storage, improving the services and helping FlatChat serve you better.

                    Where we propose to use your personal information (that is, information that may be used to identify the User and that is not otherwise publicly available) for any other uses, we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.

                    By using the Portal, you hereby expressly agree and grant consent to the collection, use, and storage of this information by FlatChat. FlatChat reserves the right to share, disclose and transfer information collected hereunder with its own affiliates. In the event FlatChat sells or transfers all or a portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets that are shared, disclosed, or transferred as part of the transaction. You hereby expressly grant consent and permission to FlatChat for the disclosure and transfer of information to such third parties. FlatChat may share information as provided by you and data concerning usage of the Services with its commercial partners for the purpose of facilitating user engagement, marketing, promotional purposes, and other related purposes. Further, FlatChat reserves the right to disclose personal information as obligated by law in response to duly authorised legal processes and governmental requests and as necessary to protect the rights and interests of FlatChat.

                </p>

                <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies" or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified device. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), FlatChat has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's device. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. FlatChat’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that FlatChat does not control.
                    FlatChat's web servers automatically collect limited information about the User's device's connection to the Internet, including the User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets devices attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. FlatChat uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal, and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where FlatChat's visitors come.

                </p>

                <h2>Security Procedures</h2>
                <p>
                    All information gathered on FlatChat is securely stored within FlatChat- a controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to such servers is password-protected and strictly limited based on a need-to-know basis. However, we understand that as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Further, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with Internet access. By using the Portal, you understand and agree that your information may be used in or transferred to countries other than India.
                    FlatChat also believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium. We may periodically review from time to time and change our privacy policy to incorporate future changes that may be considered appropriate without any notice to you. Our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, how we store it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

                <p>
                    Your personal information may be retained and may continue to be used until (i) the relevant purposes for the use of your information described in this Privacy Policy are no longer applicable, and (ii) we are no longer required by applicable law, regulations, contractual obligations or legitimate business purposes to retain your personal information and the retention of your personal information is not required for the establishment, exercise or defence of any legal claim.

                <h2>User Account and Data Deletion</h2>
                <p>
                    Users are entitled to request FlatChat to delete their User accounts and their personal information by sending an email with their written request to contact@flatchat.app
                    We will do our best to respond promptly and, in any event, within one month of the following:
                    Our receipt of your written request; or
                    Our receipt of any further information we may ask you to provide to enable us to comply with your request, whichever is later.
                    As an alternative to account deletion, by writing to contact@FlatChat.app, you also have the option to request either:
                    (i) the suspension of your account, after which you will not be able to play paid contests on your User account but will continue to have access to other parts of the Portal; or
                    (ii) temporary deactivation of your account, where you will no longer be able to log into the Portal but which allows you to request reactivation of your account with all your account data.

                    If you proceed with permanently deactivating your account, you will lose access to the Portal and the Services, including any User data and the personal information associated with your account. Users may request account restoration within three (3) months from the date of notification of account deletion by FlatChat by writing to contact@flatchat.app.

                    When you request the deletion of your data, we follow a deletion process that ensures that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you request the deletion and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
